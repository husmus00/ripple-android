Some Android smartphone manufacturers, such as Samsung and Oneplus, allow for the installation of copies of certain apps (typically messaging apps) using Android's native user system.
This app helps circumvent this limitation using ADB to install (almost) any app to the dual profile. It allows users to select an app and install it by sending the necessary ADB commands to Termux.
Permissions must also be manually granted since the system will think they are granted on the dual app when they are only granted for the main app.

This app is a work in progress and still lacks some core features.

This app requires a working installation of Termux which allows third-party apps and is running ADB (install android-tools)
